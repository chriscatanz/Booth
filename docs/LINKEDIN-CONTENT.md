## Week 1: The Announcement

### Post 1: The Origin Story (Monday)

I've been a trade show manager for 10 years.

In that time, I've:
- Shipped booth kits to 200+ venues
- Lost track of a $3,000 power strip (twice)
- Built 47 different "master spreadsheets"
- Promised myself I'd "get organized" 100 times

Last month, I finally snapped.

Not at a vendor. Not at a freight company.

At a Google Sheet.

It was 23 tabs. Formula errors everywhere. Version conflicts with my team. And somehow STILL missing the hotel confirmation for next week's show.

So I built the tool I wish existed.

It's called Booth.

One place for:
✓ Show schedules
✓ Budgets (that actually calculate correctly)
✓ Team assignments
✓ Shipping deadlines
✓ All your documents

No more spreadsheet archaeology.

I'm not a VC-backed startup. I'm a marketing guy who got tired of the chaos.

If you manage trade shows for a living, I built this for you.

### Post 2: The Problem (Wednesday)

Every trade show manager I know has the same dirty secret:

The "system" is chaos in a trench coat.

Shared drives with 47 versions of "Budget_FINAL_v3_REAL.xlsx"

Email threads from 6 months ago with critical vendor info buried somewhere

A calendar that's missing half the deadlines

And that one Google Sheet that's load-bearing for the entire program

(If Sarah leaves, we're all screwed)

We're marketing professionals running million-dollar programs on tools meant for grocery lists.

It doesn't have to be this way.

### Post 3: The Metric Nobody Tracks (Friday)

Hot take: Most companies have no idea what their trade shows actually cost.

"We spent $15,000 on that show."

Did you though?

Did you count:
- Booth fee ✓
- Travel (flights, hotels, meals) ?
- Shipping (there AND back) ?
- Drayage (that surprise $800 bill) ?
- Electricity, wifi, lead scanners ?
- The emergency Uber when the van was late ?

When I actually tracked everything for a year, our "cheap" shows were sometimes the most expensive per lead.

And our "expensive" shows with premium booth placement? Best ROI in the program.

You can't optimize what you can't measure.

## Week 2: Education

### Post 4: The Packing List That Saved Me

The best career advice I ever got about trade shows:

"The venue will have everything. At 10x the price."

So I built a master packing list.

Not a mental checklist. An actual, written-down, checked-every-single-time list.

It includes obvious things:
□ Tablecloth
□ Business cards
□ Brochures

And not-so-obvious things:
□ Power strip (venues charge $75/day)
□ Extension cord (see above)
□ Blue painter's tape
□ Zip ties
□ Basic tool kit
□ Backup laptop charger

The list has saved me probably $10,000 over the years.

And a lot of panic.

### Post 5: The Lead Quality Problem

I used to celebrate getting 200 leads at a show.

Then I learned to count differently:

200 badge scans
- 80 competitors and vendors (bye)
- 45 "just browsing" (never respond to follow-up)
- 30 wrong company size
- 25 wrong industry
- 15 already customers

= 5 actual prospects

That's $3,000 per qualified lead on a $15,000 show.

Now I track two numbers:
1. Qualified leads (fits ICP, has budget, has timeline)
2. Cost per qualified lead

Some "bad" shows became great when I looked at quality.
Some "great" shows became terrible.

Vanity metrics are expensive.

## Week 3: Product Focus

### Post 6: Why Booth Exists

Trade show software exists.

It's either:
A) Enterprise-priced ($200+/mo)
B) Built for massive expo organizers
C) Just another PM tool with a calendar

I needed something different:

- For the marketing team, not the venue
- Actually affordable for SMBs
- Purpose-built for exhibit management
- Simple enough to actually use

So I built Booth.

$49/month. 5 minutes to set up. Built by someone who's lived the chaos.

Now in public beta.

### Post 7: Feature Spotlight - Shipping Deadlines

The most expensive mistake in trade shows:

Missing a shipping deadline.

Advance warehouse cutoffs are usually 2-3 weeks before the show.

Miss it? You're paying:
- Rush shipping ($$$)
- Direct-to-show rates ($$$$)
- Or worse: your booth arrives late

I've seen companies spend an extra $5,000 because someone forgot a date.

That's why Booth shows shipping deadlines front and center.

Not buried in a spreadsheet. Not in someone's calendar.

Right there. Every time you look at a show.
