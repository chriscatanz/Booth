## Pro Tips

1. **Don't forget drayage** - It's the #1 surprise cost. Budget $1-3 per pound each way.

2. **Track EVERYTHING** - Include small expenses like Ubers and coffee. They add up.

3. **Use estimated vs. actual** - Pre-show estimates help with budgeting. Post-show actuals help you learn.

4. **Amortize booth costs** - If you own a $20K booth and use it 10 times, allocate $2K per show.

5. **Include hidden time** - Staff salaries during prep/travel are real costs.
