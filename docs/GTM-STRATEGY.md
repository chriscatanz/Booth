## 1. Positioning

### Core Message
**"Finally, trade show software built by someone who's been in the trenches."**

### Value Proposition
Booth replaces the chaos of spreadsheets, email threads, and sticky notes with a single source of truth for your entire trade show program.

### Differentiators
| Booth | Competitors |
|-------|-------------|
| Built by a practitioner | Built by software companies |
| Clean, modern UI | Cluttered, outdated interfaces |
| SMB-friendly pricing ($49-99/mo) | Enterprise pricing ($99-199+/mo) |
| Focused feature set | Feature bloat |
| Fast onboarding (<5 min) | Complex setup |

### Competitive Landscape
- **ExhibitDay**: $99-199/mo, feature-rich but complex
- **Generic PM tools**: Notion, Monday, Asana — not purpose-built
- **Spreadsheets**: The status quo we're replacing
